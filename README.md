A school project website made with nodeJS and javascript that showcasess Products, Employees of the company.
One can edit products and employees by going to path /admin.

In order for the website to function, you need to create a database locally with the name "koala".
I have included an sql file which has every data and tables of the database. 
You can execute the code in the sql command section of the database. 

Thank you!
